# ChatLore 

> A Retrieval Augmented Generation powered application to chat with your research papers. While you can directly start playing with ChatLore, you can also experiment with its various model settings (Chunk Size, Chunk Overlaps, Retrieval Methods and Text Splitter Methods). ChatLore provides evaluations after each response going off three major criteria: Answer Relevance, Context Relevance and Faithfulness.

## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/Flask server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.
This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/python/nextjs-flask/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.
On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:5328` port, which is where the Flask server is running.
In production, the Flask server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-title=Next.js%20Flask%20Starter&demo-description=Simple%20Next.js%20boilerplate%20that%20uses%20Flask%20as%20the%20API%20backend.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs-flask-starter.vercel.app%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F795TzKM3irWu6KBCUPpPz%2F44e0c6622097b1eea9b48f732bf75d08%2FCleanShot_2023-05-23_at_12.02.15.png&project-name=Next.js%20Flask%20Starter&repository-name=nextjs-flask-starter&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fexamples%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fpython%2Fnextjs-flask&from=vercel-examples-repo)

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-flask --example "https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/python/nextjs-flask"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The Flask server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5328](http://127.0.0.1:5328) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
